fifa-tracker
===========
Something we use to track wins/losses in Fifa 2014 at Modus Create. Fun little side project that uses Angular, and was my first intro to Jade. Also my first time using Firebase as a persistance store.

Deployed to heroku at: [http://fifa-tracker.herokuapp.com](http://fifa-tracker.herokuapp.com)
